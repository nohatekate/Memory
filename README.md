MEMORY

Rules:
Cards start face down on table
Player takes first turn by turning over two cards
if two cards match player keeps cards 
if two cards don't match - player turns cards back over and tries again
game is over when all cards match or if player can't match in time

**Planned Future Enhancements**
  - Shuffle All Cards-
  - Timer 
      use timer for tracking how long it takes player to make all matching pairs
      keep track of best time
  - flip animation to show images
  - flip animation to automatically flip card to not showing when guess is incorrect
  - Option for number of cards to match each game
  - CSS allow for screen size changes / media queries
  - Do not allow clikcs on matched pairs

**Known Bugs**
  - Can reclick on an already matched pair repeatedly and win game on same matching pair
  - Can reclick on one already matched card - causes game to reevaluate card with next card clicked
